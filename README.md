My Name is Prudhvi Raj Botsa

Here I am presenting my fundamental project.

My project name is TwitterUser Project.

Here I have done different functionalities like SignUp, SignIn, view profile, viewAll profile, delete profile, edit profile, search profile, and Create timeline.

In my project I have used Factory Design pattern to create object.

And I have implemented database connectivity using JDBC.

I have created my database table in RUNSQL Command Prompt.

In my project I also used Comparator Interface to viewAll profile in sorted order that is sort by name.

I also created the User Defined Exception in createprofile functionality to check whether the name of the user is correct or wrong.

In my project I also performed the logging to store the user information into a file.

And I also implemented Unit Testing to check the test cases.

Finnaly I pushed my project into a GitHub Account and also created my README file
